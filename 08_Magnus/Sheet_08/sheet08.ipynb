You can think of the relation between such instances and their designated classes as individuals of a specific population (e.g. Bernard and Bianca are both individuals of the population mice). Class definitions contain methods, which can be used to manipulate instance of that class or to make it perform specific actions.\n",

    "Calculate the weighted sums of a neuron's inputs and apply it's activation function $\\sigma$. The output vector $o$ of perceptron $j$ of layer $k$ given an input $x$ (the output of the previous layer) in a neural network is given by the following formula. Note: $N$ gives the number of values of a given vector, $w_{j,0}(k)$ specifies the bias of perceptron $j$ in layer $k$ and $w_{j,1...N(x)}(k)$ the other weights of perceptron $j$ in layer $k$.\n",

    "This is the most complex step of the whole task. Split into three separate parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Forward propagation***: Compute the outputs for each individual layer – similar to the forward-propagation step above, but we need to keep track of the intermediate results to compute each layer's errors. That means: Store the input as the first \"output\" and then activate each of the network's layers using the *previous* layer's output and store the layer's activation result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Backward propagation***: Calculate each layer's error signals $\\delta_i(k)$. The important part here is to do so from the last to the first array, because each layer's error depends on the error from its following layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\delta_i(k) = \\varphi'_i(k) \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N(k+1)} w_{ji}(k+1,k)\\delta_j(k+1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Since we use the sigmoid function $\\sigma(t)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}$ as activation function $\\varphi$ the derivative is $\\varphi'_i(k) = \\sigma'_i(k) = \\sigma_i(k)\\ (1 - \\sigma_i(k))$ and the formula becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\delta_i(k) = \\sigma_i(k)\\ (1 - \\sigma_i(k))\\ \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N(k+1)} w_{ji}(k+1,k)\\delta_j(k+1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    (*Hint*: For the last layer (i.e. the first you calculate the $\\delta$ for) the sum in the formula above is the total network error. For all preceding layers $k$ you need to recalculate `e` using the $\\delta$ and weights of layer $k+1$. We already implemented a helper function for you to access the weights of a specific layer. Check the `PerceptronLayer` if you did not find it yet.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ***Adaptation***: Call each layers adaptation function with its input, its designated error signals and the given learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: The last two steps can be performed in a single loop if you wish, but make sure to use the non-updated weights for the calculation of the next layer's error signals!"

If you click it, many features are disabled and set to useful defaults, since they were either not discussed yet in the lecture or are not important for this exercise.\n",

    "You will see a simple configuration: Two activated inputs ($x_1$ and $x_2$), one hidden layer with one neuron (which can be understood as a simple perceptron) and the output shown as a nice picture. It initially shows a training loss of 0.527. Try and run it to see how the perceptron can learn to separate the two clusters. Note that for the rest of the exercise we assume at most about 1000 learning steps (usually many fewer will do it), so don't wait too long in front of your browser.\n",

You will notice that you won't achieve much better results than a loss of 0.4, which is just above chance. Try to improve the result by adding neurons and or layers (but don't change the inputs!) until you get a classification with a loss smaller than 0.01. You may also change the learning rate.
